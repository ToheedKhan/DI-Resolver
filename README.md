# DI-Resolver

Dependency Injection frameworks support the Inversion of Control design pattern.

**Giving an object the things it needs to do its job.**

Dependency injection allows us to write code that's loosely coupled, and as such, easier to reuse, to mock, and to test.


In object-oriented programming, there are several basic techniques to implement inversion of control. These are:

Using a service locator pattern
Using dependency injection; for example,
Constructor injection
Parameter injection
Setter injection
Interface injection
Method Injection
Using a contextualized lookup
Using the template method design pattern
Using the strategy design pattern



Dependency Injection Strategies
There are six classic dependency injection strategies:

Interface Injection
Property Injection
Constructor Injection
Method Injection
Service Locator
Annotation (NEW)
Resolver supports them all
